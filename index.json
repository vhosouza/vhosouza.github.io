Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the effect on the MEP amplitude bytwo different protocols for electrode placement. **Methods:** sEMG electrodes were placed on three upper arm muscles (biceps brachii, flexor carpi radialis, and flexor pollicis brevis) of six right-handed subjects following two different protocols (1 and 2), which varied according to the interelectrode distance and location relative to the muscle. TMS pulses were applied to the hotspot of biceps brachii, while sEMG was recorded from the two protocols and for each muscle simultaneously. **Main Results:** Greater MEP amplitudes were obtained for Protocol 1 compared to Protocol 2 (P ","tags":["TMS","Motor evoked potential","MEP","Electromyography","Electrode placement"],"title":"Motor potential evoked by transcranial magnetic stimulation depends on the placement protocol of recording electrodes: a pilot study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["J Zugaib","JR Camatti","Victor Hugo Souza"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1587427200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1599388270,"objectID":"b6efb769c56361d01129ec014a7fd0c4","permalink":"https://vhosouza.github.io/publication/tms-pain/","publishdate":"2020-04-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tms-pain/","section":"publication","summary":"Galhardoni et al. evaluated the effect of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and posterior superior insula (PSI) of patients with central neuropathic pain (CNP). Multidimensional aspects of pain were evaluated with psychophysical tests, electrophysiologic recordings, and scales. rTMS in PSI increased the threshold for heat pain, whereas in ACC improved anxiety scores. It is plausible that the neuromodulation of these structures has a therapeutic potential for CNP.  On the other hand, we recently pointed out that rTMS over PSI and ACC involve greater stimulation of superficial rather than deeper structures. In addition, estimation of the stimulation targets was based on a linear projection from the center of the coil. Linear projection does not correspond to the region of maximum induced electric field on internally folded cortical structures, which is always on the more superficial tissue; therefore, the clinical findings should not be regarded as the resultant of deep structures' stimulation instead of an ensemble of stronger spread superficial stimulation combined with deeper stimulation. Accordingly, electric field modeling may be used to guide the coil positioning and adjustment of stimulation intensity to achieve a significant pain relief. Certainly, there is great importance in the development of new therapeutic strategies for CNP.","tags":["TMS","Pain","Insular cortex","Repetitive TMS","Neuropathic pain"],"title":"Reader response: Insular and anterior cingulate cortex deep stimulation for central neuropathic pain: Disassembling the percept of pain","type":"publication"},{"authors":["MAC Garcia","Victor Hugo Souza"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1599388270,"objectID":"d774b3a1cb8d9477caa270cdb70788e4","permalink":"https://vhosouza.github.io/publication/unstandardized-dynamometer/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/unstandardized-dynamometer/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["Handheld dynamometers","Muscle force"],"title":"The (un)standardized use of handheld dynamometers on the evaluation of muscle force output","type":"publication"},{"authors":["JO Nieminen","LM Koponen","N Mäkelä","Victor Hugo Souza","M Stenroos","RJ Ilmoniemi"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1569024000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1599388270,"objectID":"86fa24b578a59acced440ded86a5a054","permalink":"https://vhosouza.github.io/publication/sici-mtms-lateral/","publishdate":"2019-09-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/sici-mtms-lateral/","section":"publication","summary":"Short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) has been studied with paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) by administering two pulses at a millisecond-scale interstimulus interval (ISI) to a single cortical target.

To overcome this limitation, we have developed a multi-locus TMS (mTMS) device, which allows controlling the stimulus location electronically. Here, we applied mTMS to study SICI in primary motor cortex with paired pulses targeted to adjacent locations, aiming to quantify the extent of the cortical region producing SICI in the location of a test stimulus. We varied the location and timing of the conditioning stimulus with respect to a test stimulus targeted to the cortical hotspot of the abductor pollicis brevis (APB) in order to study their effects on motor evoked potentials. We further applied a two-coil protocol with the conditioning stimulus given by an oval coil only to the surroundings of the APB hotspot, to which a subsequent test stimulus was administered with a figure-of-eight coil. The strongest SICI occurred at ISIs below 1 ms and at ISIs around 2.5 ms. These ISIs increased when the conditioning stimulus receded from the APB hotspot. Our two-coil paired-pulse TMS study suggests that SICI at ISIs of 0.5 and 2.5 ms originate from different mechanisms or neuronal elements.","tags":["Multi-locus TMS","Brain stimulation","Paired-pulse TMS","Short-intracortical inhibition"],"title":"Short-interval intracortical inhibition in human primary motor cortex: A multi-locus transcranial magnetic stimulation study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["RH Matsuda","GP Tardelli","CO Guimarães","VH Souza","O Baffa"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1567296000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1599388270,"objectID":"4a3c69cf05aaa3507e84f20d333c5295","permalink":"https://vhosouza.github.io/publication/review-tms-brasileira/","publishdate":"2019-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/review-tms-brasileira/","section":"publication","summary":"Transcranial magnetic stimulation is a noninvasive method of the human cortex stimulation. Known as TMS, the technique was introduced by Barker et al. in 1985. Its operation is based on the Faraday’s Law, in which an intense magnetic field that varies rapidly is able to induce an electric field in the surface of the brain, depolarizing the neurons in the cerebral cortex. Due to its versatility, TMS is currently used for both research and clinical applications. Among the clinical applications, TMS is used as a diagnostic tool and also as a therapeutic technique for some neurodegenerative diseases and psychiatric disorders such as depression, Parkinson’s disease and tinnitus. As for the diagnostic tool, motor mapping is a technique to delineate the area of representation of the target muscle in its cortical surface, whose applicability may be in studies of the cerebral physiology to evaluate damage to the motor cortex and corticospinal tract. This review aims to introduce the physics, the basic elements, the biological principles and the main applications of transcranial magnetic stimulation.","tags":["TMS","Brain stimulation"],"title":"Estimulação magnética transcraniana: uma breve revisão dos princípios e aplicações","type":"publication"},{"authors":["LR Zacharias","ASC Peres","Victor Hugo Souza","AB Conforto","O Baffa"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1555718400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1599388270,"objectID":"1e1754934041323f334c65aa386ccdb1","permalink":"https://vhosouza.github.io/publication/method-mismatch/","publishdate":"2019-04-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/method-mismatch/","section":"publication","summary":"**Background**: Small variations in TMS parameters, such as pulse frequency and amplitude may elicit distinct neurophysiological responses. Assessing the mismatch between nominal and experimental parameters of TMS stimulators is essential for safe application and comparisons of results across studies. **New method**: A search coil was used to assess exactness and precision errors of amplitude and timing parameters such as interstimulus interval, the period of pulse repetition, and intertrain interval of TMS devices. The method was validated using simulated pulses and applied to six commercial stimulators in single-pulse (spTMS), paired-pulse (ppTMS), and repetitive (rTMS) protocols, working at several combinations of intensities and frequencies. **Results**: In a simulated signal, the maximum exactness error was 1.7% for spTMS and the maximum precision error 1.9% for ppTMS. Three out of six TMS commercial devices showed exactness and precision errors in spTMS amplitude higher than 5%. Moreover, two devices showed amplitude exactness errors higher than 5% in rTMS with parameters suggested by the manufactures. **Comparison with existing methods**: Currently available tools allow characterization of induced electric field intensity and focality, and pulse waveforms of a single TMS pulse. Our method assesses the mismatch between nominal and experimental values in spTMS, ppTMS and rTMS protocols through the exactness and precision errors of amplitude and timing parameters. **Conclusions**: This study highlights the importance of evaluating the physical characteristics of TMS devices and protocols, and provides a method for on-site quality assessment of multiple stimulation protocols in clinical and research environments.","tags":["TMS","Repetitive TMS","Paired-pulse TMS","Calibration"],"title":"Method to assess the mismatch between the measured and nominal parameters of transcranial magnetic stimulation devices","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Academic \rAcademic | Documentation\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click \rPDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;\rif porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;:\rprint(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)\r  Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}}\r{{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}}\r{{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}\r Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \n A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}}\r- Only the speaker can read these notes\r- Press `S` key to view\r{{% /speaker_note %}}\r Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/media/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}\r{{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}\r{{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}\r  Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1,\r.reveal section h2,\r.reveal section h3 {\rcolor: navy;\r}\r  Questions? \rAsk\n\rDocumentation\n","date":1549324800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1597572397,"objectID":"0e6de1a61aa83269ff13324f3167c1a9","permalink":"https://vhosouza.github.io/slides/example/","publishdate":"2019-02-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/slides/example/","section":"slides","summary":"An introduction to using Academic's Slides feature.","tags":[],"title":"Slides","type":"slides"},{"authors":["J Zugaib","Victor Hugo Souza"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1545004800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1599388270,"objectID":"91f7a9c4eda4d9c0bde893b5477abc29","permalink":"https://vhosouza.github.io/publication/tms-insula/","publishdate":"2018-12-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tms-insula/","section":"publication","summary":"The insula is a cortical structure internally folded within the lateral sulcus, an anatomical border dividing the frontal, parietal and temporal lobes. Portions of these lobes that hide the insula are named as operculum (lid). Specifically, the part of the parietal lobe that forms the ceiling of the lateral sulcus operates as the secondary somatosensory cortex (S2). There is no clear functional distinction between the S2 neuronal population and the posterior insula, and thus, both are jointly characterized as the operculo-insular cortex. The operculo-insular cortex is an integrative structure that detects the intensity of multimodal spinothalamic and, possibly, interoceptive inputs, painful or not. Functional magnetic resonance imaging studies based on cytoarchitectural maps and intracortical recordings suggest an integrated functional unit with subpopulations of neurons in posterior insula primarily processing nociceptive inputs. In turn, subpopulations of neurons in S2 preferentially discriminate the nature of non-nociceptive inputs (Mazzola et al., 2012). Importantly, the operculo-insular cortex seems to be an epileptic focus in specific types of seizure, and lesions in this region correlated with the occurrence of a distinct central, neuropathic pain syndrome (Garcia-Larrea \u0026 Mauguière, 2018). The functional characterization of the human operculo-insular cortex relies on electrophysiological recordings, intraoperative stimulation, pathological conditions assessment, and functional neuroimaging (Garcia-Larrea \u0026 Mauguière, 2018). Notwithstanding, the specific functional role of operculo-insular cortex neuronal populations in the processing of each submodality of somesthetic sensation remains elusive. Recently, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was proposed as a promising technique for neuromodulation and assessment of the operculo-insular cortex (Lenoir et al., 2018).","tags":["TMS","Brain stimulation","Pain","Operculo insular cortex"],"title":"Transcranial magnetic stimulation for neuromodulation of the operculo‐insular cortex in humans","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Victor Hugo Souza","RH Matsuda","ASC Peres","PHJ Amorim","TF Moraes","JVL Silva","O Baffa"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1535068800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1599388270,"objectID":"0c2c3449791c0d46d8b3a950ec0fbd4f","permalink":"https://vhosouza.github.io/publication/invesalius-navigator/","publishdate":"2018-08-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/invesalius-navigator/","section":"publication","summary":"Neuronavigation software for transcranial magnetic stimulation.","tags":["Neuronavigation","Brain stimulation","TMS"],"title":"Development and characterization of the InVesalius Navigator software for navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Victor Hugo Souza","O Baffa","MAC Garcia"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1522540800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1599388270,"objectID":"f2b798a56899b5f394def5951dc4afcd","permalink":"https://vhosouza.github.io/publication/effect-tms-handedness/","publishdate":"2018-04-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/effect-tms-handedness/","section":"publication","summary":"Non-invasive functional brain techniques are becoming increasingly important to foster important advances in neurosciences.

However, the ability to focus the magnetic pulse to small areas is limited and the stimulus is usually restricted to cortical areas. To further improve TMS performance, new coil design will be necessary as well as methods to quickly map the 3D produced magnetic field vector. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used in this work to map the magnetic field produced by a TMS butterfly coil. Measurements were performed in vitro and in vivo.

One alternative to using cadavers or animal bodies is to employ phantoms or mimicking devices. Styrene-ethylene/butylene-styrene (SEBS) gels are biologically inert and present tunable properties, including mechanical properties that resemble the soft tissue. Therefore, SEBS is an alternative to develop a patient-specific phantom, that provides real visual and morphological experience during simulation-based neurosurgical training. **Results:** A 3D model was reconstructed and printed based on patient-specific magnetic resonance images. The fused deposition of polyactic acid (PLA) filament and selective laser sintering of polyamid were used for 3D printing. Silicone and SEBS materials were employed to mimic soft tissues. A neuronavigation protocol was performed on the 3D-printed models scaled to three different sizes, 100%, 50%, and 25% of the original dimensions. A neurosurgery team (17 individuals) evaluated the phantom realism as “very good” and “perfect” in 49% and 31% of the cases, respectively, and rated phantom utility as “very good” and “perfect” in 61% and 32% of the cases, respectively. Models in original size (100%) and scaled to 50% provided a quantitative and realistic visual analysis of the patient’s cortical anatomy without distortion. However, reduction to one quarter of the original size (25%) hindered visualization of surface details and identification of anatomical landmarks. **Conclusions:** A patient-specific phantom was developed with anatomically and spatially accurate shapes, that can be used as an alternative for surgical planning.

However, the present literature still lacks standardization protocols and comprehensive discussions about possible influences of sEMG electrode placement and montages on TMS evoked responses. With the advent of TMS by Barker et al. (1985), several advances have been made in basic and clinical neurophysiology (Rossini et al., 2015). In TMS, a high-intensity brief magnetic pulse applied with a coil over the subject's scalp, induces an electric field across the cortical tissue that depolarizes a group of neuronal pools. Therefore, if a single pulse is applied over a particular spot of the primary motor cortex (M1), the generated action potentials travel down the corticospinal tract reaching a specific muscle or group of muscles, which in turn can be achieved by recording their myoelectric activities. Such myoelectric activity may contain potentials varying from a few micro to millivolts and are recognized as motor evoked potentials (MEPs). MEPs can be recorded by means of sEMG with different electrode types, e.g. surface or indwelling, and montages, e.g. mono and bipolar. Most TMS applications take advantage of MEP amplitude and latency to evaluate the integrity and/or excitability of the motor corticospinal pathway to study normal and abnormal aspects of neurophysiology, including the pathophysiology of many neurological and motor disorders. Some may believe that differences in electrode arrangement for recording MEPs can offer a small impact in data quality; in this case he/she may be a victim of an ordinary pitfall. Thus, we may ask and discuss along this manuscript, what are the disadvantages and advantages of recording MEPs from different surface electrode montages? Do they provide a robust and similar comprehension of motor corticospinal excitability?","tags":["TMS","Brain stimulation","Motor evoked potential","MEP"],"title":"Can the recording of motor potentials evoked by transcranial magnetic stimulation be optimized?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Victor Hugo Souza","TM Vieira","ASC Peres","MAC Garcia","CD Vargas","O Baffa"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1501545600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1599388270,"objectID":"1416f6a99635a0e36a971ccf075fd03f","permalink":"https://vhosouza.github.io/publication/effect-tms-orient/","publishdate":"2017-08-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/effect-tms-orient/","section":"publication","summary":"Previous reports on the relationship between coil orientation and amplitude of motor evoked potential (MEP) in transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) did not consider the effect of electrode arrangement.

Moreover, we test whether conventional mono- and bipolar montages provide representative MEPs compared to those from the grid of electrodes. Our results show that MEPs with the greatest amplitudes were elicited for 45° and 90° coil orientations, i.e. perpendicular to the central sulcus, for all electrode montages. Stimulation with the coil oriented at 135° and 315°, i.e. parallel to the central sulcus, elicited the smallest MEP amplitudes. Additionally, changes in coil orientation did not affect the spatial distribution of MEPs over the muscle extent. It has been shown that conventional electrodes with detection volume encompassing the APB belly may detect representative MEPs for optimal coil orientations. In turn, non-optimal orientations were identified only with the grid of electrodes.

In order to accomplish this, we established an effective collaboration between Ribeirao Preto Clinics Hospital (HCRP) and Renato Archer Center for Information Technology (CTI). Printed biomodels can be used to support discussions, decision-making, and neuronavigation before surgery. The main purpose of 3D printing for specific case handling is to reduce damage by enhancing knowledge of orientation during surgical planning and personnel training before surgery. Here, we produced an object that represented the brain and face segment of a patient via additive manufacturing technology based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. Specific landmarks were measured by three distinct methods: manual caliper, an InVesalius software measurement tool, and neuronavigation coordinate detection. The mean coefficient of variation was 7.17% between all methods and landmarks measured. Our results validate the combined use of biomodels with InVesalius software tools for the assessment of individual brain anatomy facilitating manual handling and visualization of 3D models. The establishment of communication protocols between the teams involved, as well as navigation protocols for quality control, presents the possibility of developing long term training programs, and promotes the congregation of individuals from research areas in Medical Physics, Medical Sciences, and Neuroscience.","tags":["TMS","Brain stimulation","Pain","Operculo insular cortex"],"title":"Inter-institutional protocol describing the use of three-dimensional printing for surgical planning in a patient with childhood epilepsy: From 3D modeling to neuronavigation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["ASC Peres","Victor Hugo Souza","EM Rodrigues","CEG Salmon","DB de Araujo","O Baffa"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1270080000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1599388270,"objectID":"54714d901d18b2d8db3b11501a65958a","permalink":"https://vhosouza.github.io/publication/spatial-tms-fmri/","publishdate":"2010-04-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/spatial-tms-fmri/","section":"publication","summary":"We present a mobile visual clothing search system whereby a smart phone user can either choose a social networking photo or take a new photo of a person wearing clothing of interest and search for similar clothing in a retail database. From the query image, the person is detected, clothing is segmented, and clothing features are extracted and quantized. The information is sent from the phone client to a server, where the feature vector of the query image is used to retrieve similar clothing products from online databases. The phone's GPS location is used to re-rank results by retail store location. State of the art work focuses primarily on the recognition of a diverse range of clothing offline and pays little attention to practical applications. Evaluated on a challenging dataset, the system is relatively fast and achieves promising results.","tags":["TMS","Brain stimulation","Pain","Operculo insular cortex"],"title":"Real-time spatial localization system of brains regions for TMS application by co-registration with fMRI","type":"publication"},{"authors":["ASC Peres","Victor Hugo Souza","D Maziero","DB de Araujo","CEG Salmon","O Baffa"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1252713600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1599388270,"objectID":"483f8aeeb6639c9db51ae503da321908","permalink":"https://vhosouza.github.io/publication/vector-mri-tms/","publishdate":"2009-09-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/vector-mri-tms/","section":"publication","summary":"Non-invasive functional brain techniques are becoming increasingly important to foster important advances in neurosciences. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is one possibility whose applications have been spreading to several areas of neuroscience. By producing high intensity magnetic flux changes TMS is able to depolarize neurons thus eliciting brain or nerve responses. However, the ability to focus the magnetic pulse to small areas is limited and the stimulus is usually restricted to cortical areas. To further improve TMS performance, new coil design will be necessary as well as methods to quickly map the 3D produced magnetic field vector. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used in this work to map the magnetic field produced by a TMS butterfly coil. Measurements were performed in vitro and in vivo. The reliability of the results suggests the use of MRI to produce magnetic field mapping, in conjunction with other techniques, to develop TMS coils for different purposes.","tags":["TMS","Brain stimulation","Magnetic field mapping","Magnetic resonance imaging"],"title":"Vector magnetic field mapping of a transcranial magnetic stimulation coil using magnetic resonance imaging: in-vitro and in-vivo experiments","type":"publication"}]
