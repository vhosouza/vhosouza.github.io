The course content is the course. Online learning can be fun, interactive and bind people. Knowledge is acquired in different forms, from group work to reflections posted in the blog.\nThe Online Networked Learning course has come to an end. It has been a great journey with intense group and individual work. It was intense, took considerable effort and time, but didn’t feel so. ONL was amazingly well organized with a diverse set of engaging activities. In the middle of the course I even asked myself, what am I learning here? What is the focus? When I realized that the course content and learning outcomes was right in front of me, as the course itself, I got really excited.\nWe were all there to learn about opennes, sharing, collaborative and network learning, online course design, and digital literacy in teaching. Every topic transition was smooth and seemed pretty well interconnected.\nA quick summary of the main topics:\nOnline participation \u0026amp; digital literacies Open Learning - sharing and opennes Learning in communities - network collaborative learning Design for online and blended learning Which basically covered:\nDigital literacy enables you to map your knowledge and use of digital tools, useful when creating and managing online courses When you create an online course, think about openning and sharing, you may get useful reviews, comments and critiques Online learning benefits from creating a community of strongly connected people, building a community and network connections promote learning Different frameworks and models have been postulated when designing an online course, raising the importance of scaffolding students, thinking about social, cognitive, and teaching presences. I would probably change the order that topics are presented, as below:\nOnline participation \u0026amp; digital literacies Design for online and blended learning Learning in communities - network collaborative learning Open Learning - sharing and opennes Course design is one of the most important topics, but came on a period that students were already stuffed with work. I felt that, in general, people engaged a bit less in this topic than the preceding ones. So, I would like to have first the discussions on digital literacy, then study about the course design models, then address the learning in communities to finally reflect on open learning by sharing.\nOverall, the group work was amazing. Through the PBL activities and follwing the FISh model really promoted an interactive and collaborative work. I realized that with approapriate design and methods it is possible to have fun and fruitful online activities in group. In my next course, I’ll certainly promote these activities and implement most of the principles I learning in the ONL. These need to be done slowly as they require more effort from the teacher, and trying to implement all at one may overwhel me, as a teacher, and the students.\nOnce more, I would like to thank all my colleagues from the PBL group 1, through which I learned so much, had lots of fun and am grateful to be part of it. Thanks Mohit, Kinaz, Marcus, Stephanie, Hui-Chen, Erik, and Vigdis, with the great guidance by Charlotta and Cecilia. 😄\nGroup 6 members: Victor Souza, Mohit Gupta, Kinaz Al Aytouni, Marcus Stensmyr, Stephanie Birkner, Hui-Chen, Erik Elfgren, Vigdis Ahnfelt, Charlotta Hilli, and Cecilia Hellekant. ↩︎\n","date":1607040000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1607212800,"objectID":"e0fcddab2999c85941de7e184eb88964","permalink":"https://vhosouza.github.io/post/t5-end/","publishdate":"2020-12-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/t5-end/","section":"post","summary":"The final week of the ONL course, time to reflect.","tags":["ONL202","Pedagogy"],"title":"Topic 5: Unfortunately, the end...","type":"post"},{"authors":["Victor H.

Students should sense ownership of their learning path. Teacher supports with clear instructions, fostering learning in a flexible environment. Check out the main models for desiging blended courses.\nBlended learning This week’s topic is about methods to support course design in Blended Learning. A first question that comes up is: What is blended learning?.\nBlended learning is combining online and in-classroom activities to expose students to different types of learning methods. The blended learning is an interesting concept because of the greater selection of tools that can be employed to engage students. Our current teaching challanges due to the pandemic restrictions also push the development of such blended activities.\nTeaching in hard sciences, e.g., physics and computer science, can greately benefit from blended learning. However, most of higher education institutions are still mostly delivering content in the traditional lecture style. However, these fields have the great advantage of dealing with problem solving cases, which can be augment by online tools. The use of online activities may raise the interest of the students and motivate them to engage more with the course activities. This is only succesfully achieved, if the teacher provides scaffolding through constant check ups and clear instructions.\nThe clear set of instructions and norms are possibly the most important thing to consider when desiging a blended course. Students can easily get overwhelmed in an online environment with the plethora of information. In flexible learning environment, the student motivation can significantly decay if the learning path is not well-defined and possibly lose the sense of purpose. In the topic below, I listed three models worth checking to assist in designing a blended course.\nFrameworks and models for blended learning This week, our PBL group 1 prepared a compass rose point to different directions each representing a framework or model to support designing a blended course. We highlighted the:\nABC Arena for Blended Learning: Designed at the University College London, it provides a well-structured model with step-by-step instructions on how to quickly adapt the teaching activities to online mode. The 5 stage model: Provides a structured development process that supports the construction of better online learning. The Community of Inquiry: Introduces a framework to create a home for a community escaping from the conventional teaching styles and is based on engaging students to create paths and explore what they want to learn, taking a more flexible approach to learning. Below, you will find a snapshot of our Compass Rose work, and here you can access the interactive board we built.\nLearning in communities Group 6 members: Victor Souza, Mohit Gupta, Kinaz Al Aytouni, Marcus Stensmyr, Stephanie Birkner, Hui-Chen, Erik Elfgren, Vigdis Ahnfelt, Charlotta Hilli, and Cecilia Hellekant. ↩︎\n","date":1606435200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1606694400,"objectID":"0315e862db712ebd293685ade14fd553","permalink":"https://vhosouza.github.io/post/t4-blended-design/","publishdate":"2020-11-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/t4-blended-design/","section":"post","summary":"The theories for desining online courses.","tags":["ONL202","Pedagogy"],"title":"Topic 4: Design for online and blended learning","type":"post"},{"authors":["Victor H.

Both types have important contributions to the development of knolwedge in higher education. Teachers should account for each student characteristics and design group activities that foster a collaborative work. PBL groups and interdependent assements are great starting points.\nCollaborative x network learning There is a great challenge in current higher education in achieving collaborative learning. In most cases, group activies are designed in a way that the level of engagement between students vary considerably. In online courses, the situation is even more critical as digital literacy may hinder some student’s participation. In this context, teachers play an important role in designing the courses and activities to foster a collaborative and active participation of the students, promoting learning in communities through joint, fun steps.\nThe pedagogical training provided at Aalto University has been an eye-opening for the benefits of network and collaborative learning. Especifically, the ONL202 activities have demonstrated the feasibility of real collaborative learning through the problem based learning (PBL) groups led by two facilitators. The interesting feature about ONL202 is we construct our knowledge based on the experiences shared by our teammates and through the process of accomplishing the necessary tasks. We not only support the work of our colleagues (cooperation) but we also build together (collaboration) solutions to common learning problems.\nWorking in a research group in a University, my Personal Learning Network is strongly populated with my work peers. Luckily, I also have strong learning connections with my parents and relatives. Both my parents and many of my close relatives are teachers, which created in my childhood an environment based on learning activities.\nOne special link that is part of anyone’s learning network is the internet. Nowadays, the new standard is to learn through the myriad of content, e.g., videos, blogs, openly available in the internet. Therefore, technological advances and the building up of social networks have enabled the expansions of our own personal learning network beyond our daily circle. Looking from outside, openness and sharing are the pillars of network learning in current society. But it’s important to note that collaborative activies are necessary in higher education. For the differences between collaborative and network learning, check the slide below prepared by our PBL group 1.\nLearning in communities Towards collaborative learning We (PBL group 1) prepared a few slides with some relevant tips for designing courses to encourage students to collaborate, work in groups, and a few strategies to support teachers when implementing collaborative learning. Feel free to take a look at it here.\nGroup 6 members: Victor Souza, Mohit Gupta, Kinaz Al Aytouni, Marcus Stensmyr, Stephanie Birkner, Hui-Chen, Erik Elfgren, Vigdis Ahnfelt, Charlotta Hilli, and Cecilia Hellekant. ↩︎ ↩︎\n","date":1605398400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1606694400,"objectID":"1ee6ace28f5960c02faa94fcb104f24a","permalink":"https://vhosouza.github.io/post/t3-collab-coop/","publishdate":"2020-11-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/t3-collab-coop/","section":"post","summary":"The strategies for building collaborative learning.","tags":["ONL202","Pedagogy"],"title":"Topic 3: Learning in communities – networked collaborative learning","type":"post"},{"authors":["Victor H.

There are many online tools and local oportunities to start being an open teacher. The benefits of open education can reach beyond the expected. Yet, barriers exist and should be considered down the road to openness.\nToday we talk about open education. During the ONL course activities, my first impression was that attending teachers and students were mostly concerned about the barriers and dangers in becoming open, while the benefits and impacts were hindered. Open education is paramount in providing accessibility to education resourses for those who could not access it before. To raise awareness about the possible benefits in promoting Open Education, I prepared an introductory video that you can check below:\nThe road to Open Education Our (PBL group 1) prepared a presentation to introduce the road to Open Education for someone interested in joining this endeavour. You can navigate through the road from the Start, where we gathered some useful tools that can be used to prepare and make available open courses. It’s very important to remember that this is a joint effort between the teacher and the institution. Openning a course can be time consuming and requires strong support from colleagues, admnistration, and staff. On the path to openness, additional care should be taken with copyrights, ethical and privacy issues, and so on. Nonetheless, the ultimate benefits and impacts might manifest as a more inclusive and equal society, promote personal development and critical thinking, and lastly create a community of people that share and exchange knowledge.\nThe road to open education References A few interesting scientific publications about Open Education\nBozkurt et. al (2019) An analysis of peer reviewed publications on openness in education in half a century: Trends and patterns in the open hemisphere, Australasian Journal of Educational Technology, v.35\nSeo et al.

I hope that my posts will bring useful information for everyone interested in pedagogy and online learning.\nTL;DR\nOnline learning opens the possibility for teaching methods that address each individual needs, but requires an appropriate knowledge for a successful implementation.\nThe visitor and resident map is a good first activity to illustrate personal online engagement; Use inclusive tools, provide clear instructions; Account for all types of inteligence. People learn differently also in the online environment. Be prepared to swictch roles with students, many are native in technology. Digitalization opens many new possibilities to improve teaching and learning in multiple levels. Teachers are now capable of providing more diverse, accessible practices that suit well each kind of intelligence and social background. However, fostering online participation and engagement with online tools requires that both teachers and students are reasonably comfortable and literate in digital technologies. These requirements are potentially dangerous in segregating those students with limited online access and may also bring more stress and additional load to the teachers to handle. Here, I discuss a few points to assist teachers on making better use of the digital environment to foster better learning practices.\n1. The visitor and residents map David White presented the interesting Visitor and Resident framework to map how we engage with different digital tools. In this chart, one drafts a two-axis chart with Visitor and Resident on the limits of the X axis and Personal and Work on the limits of the Y axis. Then, the person is free to place any number of digital tools (e.g., e-mail, office software, YouTube, blogs) in the chart to illustrate how he/she considers to use these tools in the personal and work context.\nThe visitor and resident map can be quite useful for a teacher as a breaking-the-ice activity in the begining of a course, to get to know better the students’ engagement with the online world, and subsequently tailor the learning activities accordingly. In the video below, David White makes an elegant and quick introduction to the Vistor and Resident model.\n2. Multiple intelligences We, human beings, exhibit a diverse set of intelligences, which are nicely described by Howard Gardner’s work on multiple intelligence and education (Smith, Mark K.; 2002, 2008). Teachers should be aware that each student may learn through different means. Gardner’s theory propose the following multiple intelligences:\nLinguistic Logical-mathematical Musical Bodily-kinesthetic Saptial Interpersonal Intrapersonal We could add another type of intelligence, the Digital intelligence, which shapes how we absorb information, interact, and create knowledge through digital means. Childrens and adolescentes have been already exposed through their whole lifes to digital technologies, in the form of games, online activities, and social interactions. In this scenario, the digital world creates a novel intelligence that also contributes to how we learn through digital means. Putting yourself in the younger’s perspective, you will probably realize that it’s getting harder to think how can we learn something if we can’t search or interact with it online. You can navigate through our Miro board to explore the content we created.\n3. Online engagement: How to improve it? As a group effort, we (Group 61) created the DigiLit Fish (figure below) as a diagram with questions and answers (recommendations) on how to improve the online participation and student engagement in the digital learning spaces.\nThe DigiLit Fish by Group 6 ONL202 Promoting online engagement is a difficult task that requires full consideration of the cultural background, tools, and participants’ roles (teachers and students) (Yengin et al., 2010). Cultural and social background defines several aspects of the digital literacy. For example, different than in classical lectures, in online teaching the students might know better how to use digital tools than the teachers, switching the role with the teacher. Teachers should be prepared to benefit from this situation.\nThe selected tools for teaching should be clearly introduced and selected to promote inclusion of every student, considering possible access limitations and how they operate as visitors or residents. There are a plethora of webpages that compiled available free online tools for teaching, for instance here and here.\nWe may assume that students can easily adapt to novel technologies, however, clear training and instructions would possibly contribute to a more efficient learning and online engagement (Ozdamar-Keskin et al., 2015).\nThe online engagement diagram References Ozdamar-Keskin et al.

Multidimensional aspects of pain were evaluated with psychophysical tests, electrophysiologic recordings, and scales. rTMS in PSI increased the threshold for heat pain, whereas in ACC improved anxiety scores. It is plausible that the neuromodulation of these structures has a therapeutic potential for CNP.  On the other hand, we recently pointed out that rTMS over PSI and ACC involve greater stimulation of superficial rather than deeper structures. In addition, estimation of the stimulation targets was based on a linear projection from the center of the coil. Linear projection does not correspond to the region of maximum induced electric field on internally folded cortical structures, which is always on the more superficial tissue; therefore, the clinical findings should not be regarded as the resultant of deep structures' stimulation instead of an ensemble of stronger spread superficial stimulation combined with deeper stimulation. Accordingly, electric field modeling may be used to guide the coil positioning and adjustment of stimulation intensity to achieve a significant pain relief. Certainly, there is great importance in the development of new therapeutic strategies for CNP.","tags":["TMS","Pain","Insular cortex","Repetitive TMS","Neuropathic pain"],"title":"Reader response: Insular and anterior cingulate cortex deep stimulation for central neuropathic pain: Disassembling the percept of pain","type":"publication"},{"authors":["MAC Garcia","Victor H.

It has, however, been difficult to study the interaction of nearby cortical targets with paired-pulse TMS. To overcome this limitation, we have developed a multi-locus TMS (mTMS) device, which allows controlling the stimulus location electronically. Here, we applied mTMS to study SICI in primary motor cortex with paired pulses targeted to adjacent locations, aiming to quantify the extent of the cortical region producing SICI in the location of a test stimulus. We varied the location and timing of the conditioning stimulus with respect to a test stimulus targeted to the cortical hotspot of the abductor pollicis brevis (APB) in order to study their effects on motor evoked potentials. We further applied a two-coil protocol with the conditioning stimulus given by an oval coil only to the surroundings of the APB hotspot, to which a subsequent test stimulus was administered with a figure-of-eight coil. The strongest SICI occurred at ISIs below 1 ms and at ISIs around 2.5 ms. These ISIs increased when the conditioning stimulus receded from the APB hotspot. Our two-coil paired-pulse TMS study suggests that SICI at ISIs of 0.5 and 2.5 ms originate from different mechanisms or neuronal elements.","tags":["Multi-locus TMS","Brain stimulation","Paired-pulse TMS","Short-intracortical inhibition"],"title":"Short-interval intracortical inhibition in human primary motor cortex: A multi-locus transcranial magnetic stimulation study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["RH Matsuda","GP Tardelli","CO Guimarães","VH Souza","O Baffa"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1567296000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1567296000,"objectID":"4a3c69cf05aaa3507e84f20d333c5295","permalink":"https://vhosouza.github.io/publication/review-tms-brasileira/","publishdate":"2019-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/review-tms-brasileira/","section":"publication","summary":"Transcranial magnetic stimulation is a noninvasive method of the human cortex stimulation. Known as TMS, the technique was introduced by Barker et al. in 1985. Its operation is based on the Faraday’s Law, in which an intense magnetic field that varies rapidly is able to induce an electric field in the surface of the brain, depolarizing the neurons in the cerebral cortex. Due to its versatility, TMS is currently used for both research and clinical applications. Among the clinical applications, TMS is used as a diagnostic tool and also as a therapeutic technique for some neurodegenerative diseases and psychiatric disorders such as depression, Parkinson’s disease and tinnitus. As for the diagnostic tool, motor mapping is a technique to delineate the area of representation of the target muscle in its cortical surface, whose applicability may be in studies of the cerebral physiology to evaluate damage to the motor cortex and corticospinal tract. This review aims to introduce the physics, the basic elements, the biological principles and the main applications of transcranial magnetic stimulation.","tags":["TMS","Brain stimulation"],"title":"Estimulação magnética transcraniana: uma breve revisão dos princípios e aplicações","type":"publication"},{"authors":["LR Zacharias","ASC Peres","Victor H.

Assessing the mismatch between nominal and experimental parameters of TMS stimulators is essential for safe application and comparisons of results across studies. **New method**: A search coil was used to assess exactness and precision errors of amplitude and timing parameters such as interstimulus interval, the period of pulse repetition, and intertrain interval of TMS devices. The method was validated using simulated pulses and applied to six commercial stimulators in single-pulse (spTMS), paired-pulse (ppTMS), and repetitive (rTMS) protocols, working at several combinations of intensities and frequencies. **Results**: In a simulated signal, the maximum exactness error was 1.7% for spTMS and the maximum precision error 1.9% for ppTMS. Three out of six TMS commercial devices showed exactness and precision errors in spTMS amplitude higher than 5%. Moreover, two devices showed amplitude exactness errors higher than 5% in rTMS with parameters suggested by the manufactures. **Comparison with existing methods**: Currently available tools allow characterization of induced electric field intensity and focality, and pulse waveforms of a single TMS pulse. Our method assesses the mismatch between nominal and experimental values in spTMS, ppTMS and rTMS protocols through the exactness and precision errors of amplitude and timing parameters. **Conclusions**: This study highlights the importance of evaluating the physical characteristics of TMS devices and protocols, and provides a method for on-site quality assessment of multiple stimulation protocols in clinical and research environments.","tags":["TMS","Repetitive TMS","Paired-pulse TMS","Calibration"],"title":"Method to assess the mismatch between the measured and nominal parameters of transcranial magnetic stimulation devices","type":"publication"},{"authors":["J Zugaib","Victor H.

Portions of these lobes that hide the insula are named as operculum (lid). Specifically, the part of the parietal lobe that forms the ceiling of the lateral sulcus operates as the secondary somatosensory cortex (S2). There is no clear functional distinction between the S2 neuronal population and the posterior insula, and thus, both are jointly characterized as the operculo-insular cortex. The operculo-insular cortex is an integrative structure that detects the intensity of multimodal spinothalamic and, possibly, interoceptive inputs, painful or not. Functional magnetic resonance imaging studies based on cytoarchitectural maps and intracortical recordings suggest an integrated functional unit with subpopulations of neurons in posterior insula primarily processing nociceptive inputs. In turn, subpopulations of neurons in S2 preferentially discriminate the nature of non-nociceptive inputs (Mazzola et al., 2012). Importantly, the operculo-insular cortex seems to be an epileptic focus in specific types of seizure, and lesions in this region correlated with the occurrence of a distinct central, neuropathic pain syndrome (Garcia-Larrea \u0026 Mauguière, 2018). The functional characterization of the human operculo-insular cortex relies on electrophysiological recordings, intraoperative stimulation, pathological conditions assessment, and functional neuroimaging (Garcia-Larrea \u0026 Mauguière, 2018). Notwithstanding, the specific functional role of operculo-insular cortex neuronal populations in the processing of each submodality of somesthetic sensation remains elusive. Recently, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was proposed as a promising technique for neuromodulation and assessment of the operculo-insular cortex (Lenoir et al., 2018).","tags":["TMS","Brain stimulation","Pain","Operculo insular cortex"],"title":"Transcranial magnetic stimulation for neuromodulation of the operculo‐insular cortex in humans","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Victor H.

One alternative to using cadavers or animal bodies is to employ phantoms or mimicking devices. Styrene-ethylene/butylene-styrene (SEBS) gels are biologically inert and present tunable properties, including mechanical properties that resemble the soft tissue. Therefore, SEBS is an alternative to develop a patient-specific phantom, that provides real visual and morphological experience during simulation-based neurosurgical training. **Results:** A 3D model was reconstructed and printed based on patient-specific magnetic resonance images. The fused deposition of polyactic acid (PLA) filament and selective laser sintering of polyamid were used for 3D printing. Silicone and SEBS materials were employed to mimic soft tissues. A neuronavigation protocol was performed on the 3D-printed models scaled to three different sizes, 100%, 50%, and 25% of the original dimensions. A neurosurgery team (17 individuals) evaluated the phantom realism as “very good” and “perfect” in 49% and 31% of the cases, respectively, and rated phantom utility as “very good” and “perfect” in 61% and 32% of the cases, respectively. Models in original size (100%) and scaled to 50% provided a quantitative and realistic visual analysis of the patient’s cortical anatomy without distortion. However, reduction to one quarter of the original size (25%) hindered visualization of surface details and identification of anatomical landmarks. **Conclusions:** A patient-specific phantom was developed with anatomically and spatially accurate shapes, that can be used as an alternative for surgical planning.

However, the present literature still lacks standardization protocols and comprehensive discussions about possible influences of sEMG electrode placement and montages on TMS evoked responses. With the advent of TMS by Barker et al. (1985), several advances have been made in basic and clinical neurophysiology (Rossini et al., 2015). In TMS, a high-intensity brief magnetic pulse applied with a coil over the subject's scalp, induces an electric field across the cortical tissue that depolarizes a group of neuronal pools. Therefore, if a single pulse is applied over a particular spot of the primary motor cortex (M1), the generated action potentials travel down the corticospinal tract reaching a specific muscle or group of muscles, which in turn can be achieved by recording their myoelectric activities. Such myoelectric activity may contain potentials varying from a few micro to millivolts and are recognized as motor evoked potentials (MEPs). MEPs can be recorded by means of sEMG with different electrode types, e.g. surface or indwelling, and montages, e.g. mono and bipolar. Most TMS applications take advantage of MEP amplitude and latency to evaluate the integrity and/or excitability of the motor corticospinal pathway to study normal and abnormal aspects of neurophysiology, including the pathophysiology of many neurological and motor disorders. Some may believe that differences in electrode arrangement for recording MEPs can offer a small impact in data quality; in this case he/she may be a victim of an ordinary pitfall. Thus, we may ask and discuss along this manuscript, what are the disadvantages and advantages of recording MEPs from different surface electrode montages? Do they provide a robust and similar comprehension of motor corticospinal excitability?","tags":["TMS","Brain stimulation","Motor evoked potential","MEP"],"title":"Can the recording of motor potentials evoked by transcranial magnetic stimulation be optimized?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Victor H.

Here we explore this open issue by investigating whether TMS coil orientation affects the amplitude distribution of MEPs recorded from the abductor pollicis brevis (APB) muscle with a bi-dimensional grid of 61 electrodes. Moreover, we test whether conventional mono- and bipolar montages provide representative MEPs compared to those from the grid of electrodes. Our results show that MEPs with the greatest amplitudes were elicited for 45° and 90° coil orientations, i.e. perpendicular to the central sulcus, for all electrode montages. Stimulation with the coil oriented at 135° and 315°, i.e. parallel to the central sulcus, elicited the smallest MEP amplitudes. Additionally, changes in coil orientation did not affect the spatial distribution of MEPs over the muscle extent. It has been shown that conventional electrodes with detection volume encompassing the APB belly may detect representative MEPs for optimal coil orientations. In turn, non-optimal orientations were identified only with the grid of electrodes. High-density electromyography may therefore provide new insights into the effect of coil orientation on MEPs from the APB muscle","tags":["TMS","Coil orientation","Motor evoked potential","High-density EMG"],"title":"Effect of TMS coil orientation on the spatial distribution of motor evoked potentials in an intrinsic hand muscle","type":"publication"},{"authors":["ASC Peres","Victor H.
