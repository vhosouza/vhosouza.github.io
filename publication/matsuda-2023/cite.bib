 abstract = {<p>Navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS) is a valuable tool for non-invasive brain stimulation. Currently, nTMS requires fixing of markers on the patient’s head. Head marker displacements lead to changes in coil placement and brain stimulation inaccuracy. A markerless neuronavigation method is needed to increase the reliability of nTMS and simplify the nTMS protocol. In this study, we introduce and release MarLe, a Python markerless head tracker neuronavigation software for TMS. This novel software uses computer-vision techniques combined with low-cost cameras to estimate the head pose for neuronavigation. A coregistration algorithm, based on a closed-form solution, was designed to track the patient’s head and the TMS coil referenced to the individual’s brain image. We show that MarLe can estimate head pose based on real-time video processing. An intuitive pipeline was developed to connect the MarLe and nTMS neuronavigation software. MarLe achieved acceptable accuracy and stability in a mockup nTMS experiment. MarLe allows real-time tracking of the patient’s head without any markers. The combination of face detection and a coregistration algorithm can overcome nTMS head marker displacement concerns. MarLe can improve reliability, simplify, and reduce the protocol time of brain intervention techniques such as nTMS.</p>},
