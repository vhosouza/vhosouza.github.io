abstract="Most TMS applications still use subjective parameters to establish the brain area that is to be stimulated. An obvious way to improve TMS applications is to combine them with neuroimaging techniques. In order to accomplish this it is necessary to use complex techniques, i.e. neuronavigation, to perform the co-registration. Although there are commercial neuronavigation systems available, in general they are expensive and proprietary. This work aims to improve the precision of TMS applications by measuring the magnetic field produced by the coil and by using neuronavigation software based in an open architecture and free software, allowing the use of different positioning systems for the co-registration with the neuroimage.",
